# Meet Patty Cheng

**Patty Cheng is a problem-solver who has dedicated her life to smart planning and fiscal responsibility.**

As the daughter of immigrants who arrived at RDU airport over 50 years ago with little more than the luggage in their hands, Patty learned the value of hard work and careful planning from a young age. Growing up in the Triangle, she took that work ethic to NC State University, where she earned a degree in Engineering and became certified by the NC Board of Professional Engineers.

Now, she is running for Morrisville Town Council to bring a fresh perspective and a much-needed new voice to our local government. While Morrisville’s population grew 10% in the last five years, the town budget exploded by an unsustainable 74%. That’s not smart planning—it’s a threat to our town’s affordability. Patty will fight to rein in excessive spending, ensure our tax dollars are spent wisely, and keep Morrisville an affordable place for all families to live and thrive.

As a member of the Morrisville Citizens’ Budget Performance Assessment Panel from 2011 to 2014, Patty put her expertise to work for our community. During her service, the town’s responsible fiscal management earned Morrisville a AAA Bond rating. She knows what it takes to balance a budget and make government work for the people it serves.

Patty will ask the hard questions the current council has failed to address. Four years ago, taxes were raised for the $8 million “Airport Blvd Extension,” yet today, there is no progress and no answers to basic questions like how the road will cross the railroad tracks. Meanwhile, traffic on Church Street and NC-54 remains a daily frustration while our leaders have failed to secure the state funding that neighboring towns receive.

Throughout her career—as an engineer, a high school math teacher for Wake County Public Schools, and now an IT Business Analyst—Patty has used data and logic to find effective solutions. She has served our community on the Morrisville Board of Adjustment, as an HOA treasurer, and as an active member of her church.

Her motto is **“Engineer Positive Change.”** It’s a promise to use her unique background to develop sound, detailed plans for Morrisville’s future. She will fight to restore our partnership with state agencies like NCDOT and CAMPO to fund major road projects without putting the entire burden on Morrisville taxpayers. And she will collaborate with the Wake County School Board to advocate for stable, long-term school assignments, protecting our families from the constant disruption of rezoning.

As an immigrant who built a life here, Patty is deeply committed to the American Dream and to ensuring Morrisville remains a town of opportunity.

**On November 4th, you can vote for a new voice. You can vote for a proven fiscal watchdog. You can vote to Engineer Positive Change for Morrisville.**
